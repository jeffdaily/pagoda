TODO: Look for where other tools got published (e.g. NCO)

NOTES:
* need section similar to whitepaper on inadequacies of other tools
* need more detail on Climate Data Operators
* scavenge some text from Bruce's API paper
* need to cite paper expressing need for parallel climate tools

1. Intro
  a. problem statement
  b. what's been done
  c. deficiencies
  d. lsupporting R12
  e. greater I/O and memory limits
  f. Related Work
    1. NetCDF Operators (NCO)
    2. Climate Data Operators (CDO)
    3. NCAR Command Language (NCL)
    4. Ferret
    5. Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT)
2. API and capabilities
  a. subsetting and aggregation
  b. how it works
  c. similar functionality to NCO
  d. supporting emerging standards e.g. ugrid, gridspec, CF, NcML
3. Implementation
  a. GA operations used, useful ones, unique ones
  b. Reindexing 'connectivity variables'
  c. pnetcdf for parallel IO
  d. Why GA?
  e. C++ classes, dataset abstraction
