TODO: Look for where other tools got published (e.g. NCO)

NOTES:
* need section similar to whitepaper on inadequacies of other tools
* need more detail on Climate Data Operators
* scavenge some text from Bruce's API paper
* need to cite paper expressing need for parallel climate tools

1. Intro
  a. problem statement
  b. what's been done
  c. deficiencies
  d. lsupporting R12
  e. greater I/O and memory limits
2. API and capabilities
  a. subsetting and aggregation
  b. how it works
  c. similar functionality to NCO
  d. supporting emerging standards e.g. ugrid, gridspec, CF, NcML
3. Implementation
  a. GA operations used, useful ones, unique ones
  b. Reindexing 'connectivity variables'
  c. pnetcdf for parallel IO
  d. Why GA?
  e. C++ classes, dataset abstraction
4. Performance/results
  a. bigger problems (IO bound)
  b. performance (mid-range cluster size)
  c. 16,32,64,128 processors
  d. weak scaling
  e. strong scaling
5. Related Work
  a. NetCDF Operators (NCO)
