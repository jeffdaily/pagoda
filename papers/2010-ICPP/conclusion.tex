\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

We developed a novel data parallel subsetter of climate data based on
unstructured grids, the PGAS programming model, and one-sided communication.
The experimental evaluation showed scalability to thousands of processors and
acceptable IO bandwidth.  IO bandwidth is the greatest bottleneck in scaling
these types of applications.
