We are currently developing a general C++ API for climate data analysis in a
data parallel fashion.  The API will be leveraged to produce additional
command-line tools, however it is intended primarily to be used by climate
scientists to produce the kinds of tailored analyses which they require.  Time
permitting, the API will be exposed to the Python language in order to
facilitate ease of use in a scripted environment.
