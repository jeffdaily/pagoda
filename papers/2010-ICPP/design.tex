\subsection{How to Run the Subsetter}

The subsetter is the first in a series of parallel command-line tools
akin to the NetCDF Operators.\cite{NCO}  Its features most closely resemble
those of NCO's Kitchen Sink (ncks) program which allows for the extraction of
variables and hyperslabs from one or more input files.

TODO

\subsection{Dataset Abstraction}

The subsetter minimally supports two forms of input file aggregation, either
across a specified dimension e.g. time or by taking the union of all input
files such that duplicate dimensions and variables within later files are
ignored.  These forms of aggregation are modeled after what is available when
using NetCDF Markup Language.\cite{NcML} NcML input is not directly supported
at this time but is planned for a future release. 

TODO

\subsection{Parallel IO Abstraction}

The use of Parallel NetCDF was selected because work on the HDF5/NetCDF4 was
incomplete at the time of development.

TODO

\subsection{The Global Arrays Library}

TODO PGAS

TODO ONE-SIDED COMMUNICATION

TODO GA DOES IT ALL
