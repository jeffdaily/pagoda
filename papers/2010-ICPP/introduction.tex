\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

Parallel programming is needed to analyze the size of output data produced by
today's climate models\cite{MODSIM07:LOT}.  A single snapshot of a Global
Cloud Resolving Model at 4Km resolution will produce terabytes of
data\cite{GCRM}; the analysis of even a modest time series of this data will
quickly overwhelm today's software and traditional climate analysis systems.
For these data sizes, I/O bandwidth represents the single greatest bottleneck
for analysis tools.  Parallel software leveraging parallel file systems must
be used to process this data, however current climate analysis tools are at
most task parallel and rely on a single data reader\cite{CDAT,CDO,NCO}.

Many climate analysis tools robustly handle the manipulation and display of
regularly gridded data.  However, these same applications lack sufficient
features when handling unstructured or irregular grids such as the
geodesic\cite{GEODESIC} or cubed sphere\cite{CUBE} grids.  Unstructured grids
are gaining popularity, further widening the gap between current software and
these types of models.  For unstructured grids it is necessary to provide more
information about the topology of the grid and maintain the integrity of this
topology information in the face of data culling.

Regular grids allow for the topology to be implicitly defined by how
the data is stored; coordinate variables are generally monotonic and cell
neighbors are adjacent both logically and in memory. These assumptions allow
for operations over regular grids which are otherwise more difficult to
perform over unstructured grids. In the case of partitioning these grids for
data parallel processing, unstructured grids will often have more of the
logically adjacent cells scattered across memory partitions than in the
regular case.

Subsetting is a fundamental capability for any analysis tool and allows users
to operate over the regions of the data in which they are interested. The
subsetting operation is useful as part of a larger operation over the data,
such as for obtaining regional averages, but is also useful to post-process
data into a new dataset such that the cost of subsetting can be amortized
across future operations over the same region. Further, as the size of
datasets grow subsetting is important to reduce the data to a size that
traditional analysis tools are capable of handling. 

In this paper, we present a parallel tool for subsetting very large geodesic
climate data in parallel while preserving the explicit topology.  The code is
built using the Global Arrays (GA) toolkit\cite{GA} which provides an
efficient and portable "shared-memory" programming interface for
distributed-memory computers and features truly one-sided communications.  GA
traditionally deals with dense arrays, however its sparse data operations as
well as its one-sided operations allow for efficient subsetting over
unstructured grids.

The primary contributions of the paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A parallel subsetter of geodesic data based on the partitioned global address space programming model and one-sided communications
\item A novel algorithm for the maintenance of unstructured grid data
\item A novel algorithm for the subset and even distribution of unstructured grid data
\item Evaluation showing IO to be the greatest bottleneck in scaling these types of applications
\end{itemize}

The paper is organized as follows.  Section \ref{section:requirements}
describes the requirements while \ref{section:design} describes the design of
the subsetter, its algorithms, and how GA's unique features were leveraged.
Section \ref{section:evaluation} presents our experimental design and the
performance characteristics of the subsetter on nearly full-scale data set
sizes of model data up to a resolution of 4Km.  We present the capabilities
under development as well as the capabilities we would like to see in section
\ref{section:future}.  Finally, section \ref{section:conclusion} presents our
conclusions.
