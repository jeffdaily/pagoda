The size of datasets produced by current climate models is increasing rapidly
to the scale of petabytes.  To handle data at this scale parallel analysis
tools are required, however the majority of climate analysis software is
serial and remains at the scale of workstations.  Further, many climate
analysis tools are designed to process regularly gridded data but lack
sufficient features to handle unstructured grids.  This paper presents a
data-parallel subsetter capable of correctly handling unstructured grids while
scaling to over 2000 cores.  The approach is based on the partitioned global
address space (PGAS) parallel programming model and one-sided communication.
The paper demonstrates that parallel analysis of climate data succeeds in
practice, although IO remains the single greatest bottleneck.
