The size of datasets produced by current climate models is increasing rapidly
to the scale of petabytes.  To handle data at this scale parallel analysis
tools are required, however the majority of climate analysis software remain
at the scale of workstations.  Further, many climate analysis tools adequately
process regularly gridded data but lack sufficient features when handling
unstructured grids.  This paper presents a data-parallel subsetter capable of
correctly handling unstructured grids while scaling to the size of modest
analysis clusters.  The approach is based on the partitioned global address
space (PGAS) parallel programming model and one-sided communication.  The
paper demonstrates that IO remains the single greatest bottleneck for this
domain of applications and that parallel analysis of climate data succeeds in
practice.
